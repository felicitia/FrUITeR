## FrUITeR's Introduction

**Paper Abstract:** UI testing is tedious and time-consuming due to the manual effort required. Recent research has explored opportunities for reusing existing UI tests for an app to automatically generate new tests for other apps. However, the evaluation of such techniques currently remains manual, unscalable, and unreproducible, which can waste effort and impede progress in this emerging area. We introduce FrUITeR, a framework that automatically evaluates UI test reuse in a reproducible way. We apply FrUITeR to existing test-reuse tech- niques on a uniform benchmark we established, resulting in 11,917 test reuse cases from 20 apps. We report several key findings aimed at improving UI test reuse that are missed by existing work.


**FrUITeR's Workflow:** As shown in the figure below, FrUITeR takes inputs from Existing Tests and Existing Techniques (left), and outputs the evaluation Results of a given existing technique in the end (right).

**Source Tests:** the test cases that need to be transferred.

**Ground-Truth Tests:** the manually constructed test cases that represent the ground truths for the transferred test cases.

**Transferred Tests:** the test cases transferred by a given test reuse technique (i.e., what we want to evaluate).

**Event Extractor:** FrUITeR's component that converts the test cases to a uniform format of event sequences, so that the heterogenous test cases can be evaluated in the same way.

**Fidelity Evaluator:** FrUITeR's component that evaluates the *mapping* of the GUI events from the source app to the target app, based on FrUITeR's 7 fidelity metrics: (1) accuracy; (2) precision; (3) recall; (4) correct;  (5) incorrect; (6) nonExist; and (7) missed.

**GUI Maps:** the input for Fidelity Evaluator that contains the mapping of the GUI events from the source app to the target app generated by a given existing technique.

**Canonical Maps:** the input for Fidelity Evaluator that contains the manually constructed ground truths for the mapping of the GUI events from the source app to the target app.

**Utility Evaluator:** FrUITeR's component that evaluates the *usefulness* of test cases transferred by a given technique compared to the ground-truth test cases, based on FrUITeR's 2 utility metrics: (1) effort; and (2) reduction.

## FrUITeR's Components and Baseline

FrUITeR has three components (shaded boxes in the workflow), and two baseline techniques Naïve and Perfect.

### Components

**Event Extractor** is
implemented in Java using [Soot framework](https://github.com/Sable/soot) (235 SLOC).

`Location:` Repo #1 `EventExtractor/src/`

**Fidelity Evaluator** and **Utility Evaluator** are implemented in Python (1,045 SLOC). 

`Location:` Repo #2 `TestAnalyzer/gui_mapper/result_generator.ipynb`; `TestAnalyzer/gui_mapper/process_final_results.ipynb`

### Baseline

FrUITeR’s baseline techniques **Naïve** and **Perfect** are implemented in Python (112 SLOC). 

`Location:` Repo #2 `TestAnalyzer/gui_mapper/baseline/`



## Modularization of Existing Techniques

To modularize existing techniques, we (1) extracted their [GUI Mappers](#extracted-gui-mappers), and (2) unified their [GUI Maps and Transferred Tests](#unified-gui-maps-and-transferred-tests).

### Extracted GUI Mappers

The GUI Mapper components extracted from existing techniques are implemented in their original programing languages. 

**AppFlow's GUI Mapper** is implemented in Python. (1,084 SLOC). 

`Location:` Repo #3 `AppFlowGUIMapper/elements.py`

**ATM's GUI Mapper** is in Java (1,314 SLOC). 

`Location:` Repo #4 `ATMGUIMapper/src/`

**GTM's GUI Mapper** is implemented in Java (1,409 SLOC).

`Location:` Repo #5 `GTMGUIMapper/src/`

As explained in the paper (Section 5.1), we did not implement **CraftDroid's GUI Mapper**, but can only interpret its published artifacts [[link]](https://sites.google.com/view/craftdroid/); that functionality is implemented in Python (86 SLOC). 

`Location:` Repo #2 `TestAnalyzer/gui_mapper/craftdroid/`


### Unified GUI Maps and Transferred Tests

The functionality that processes the GUI Mappers' outputs and generates the uniform representation of *GUI Maps* and *Transferred Tests* (recall FrUITeR's workflow) is implemented in Python (404 SLOC). 

`Location:` Repo #2 `TestAnalyzer/gui_mapper/{technique_name}`  
*Note: GTM reused `TestAnalyzer/gui_mapper/atm`*

The processed **GUI Maps** and **Transferred Tests** are stored as `.csv` files.

`Location:` Repo #6 `GUIMaps/{technique_name}`

## FrUITeR's Benchmark

1. Benchmark Apps are located in Repo #7 `TestBenchmark/subjects/`
2. Benchmark Tests are located in Repo #7 `TestBenchmark/src/`
3. Benchmark *Canonical Maps* are located in Repo #2 `TestAnalyzer/gui_mapper/ground_truth_mapping/`

## FrUITeR's Final Datasets

Final Datasets are located in Repo #8 `DataAnalysis/FSE2020-dataset.RData`

If you are unable to view `.RData` file, the same final datasets are exported as two `.csv` files.
1. Repo #8 `DataAnalysis/final_2381.csv` contains the data of the 2,381 cases
2. Repo #8 `DataAnalysis/final_12.csv` contains the data of the 12 cases
